PAYWALL DEBUG GUIDE
===================

I've added comprehensive logging to help debug the paywall flow. 
Here's what to look for in your console logs:

EXPECTED LOG FLOW (when everything works):
------------------------------------------

1. When PersonalPlanScreen renders:
   [QuestionnaireNavigator] Rendering PersonalPlanScreen

2. When user clicks Continue button (after 100% complete):
   [PersonalPlanScreen] 🔘 Continue button pressed
   [PersonalPlanScreen] isComplete: true isPresenting: false
   [PersonalPlanScreen] paywallState: idle (or other state)
   [PersonalPlanScreen] paywallPlacement: onboarding_paywall
   [PersonalPlanScreen] 🚀 Calling showPaywall...

3. Inside usePaywall hook:
   [usePaywall] 🎯 showPaywall called with placement: campaign_trigger
   [usePaywall] 📞 Calling registerPlacement...

4. Then ONE of these outcomes:

   A) PAYWALL SHOWS (Success):
      [usePaywall] ✅ Paywall PRESENTED: <paywall_name>
      [PersonalPlanScreen] 🎬 Paywall presented callback
      ... user interacts with paywall ...
      [usePaywall] 🚪 Paywall DISMISSED with result: purchased/restored/declined
      [PersonalPlanScreen] 🏁 Paywall dismissed callback. Result: <type>

   B) PAYWALL SKIPPED (User already subscribed or holdout):
      [usePaywall] ⏭️ Paywall SKIPPED. Reason: <reason>
      [usePaywall] 🎁 Feature callback executed - user allowed through without paywall
      [PersonalPlanScreen] ⏩ Paywall skipped - user already subscribed or in holdout

   C) ERROR:
      [usePaywall] ❌ Paywall ERROR: <error message>
      [usePaywall] ❌ registerPlacement failed: <error>


COMMON ISSUES TO CHECK:
-----------------------

1. If you DON'T see "[PersonalPlanScreen] 🔘 Continue button pressed":
   → The button isn't being clicked or handleContinuePress isn't wired up

2. If you see "isComplete: false":
   → The progress animation hasn't finished yet (wait for 100%)

3. If you see "[usePaywall] ⏭️ Paywall SKIPPED":
   → Check the skip reason. Common reasons:
      - "UserIsSubscribed": User already has an active subscription
      - "Holdout": User is in a holdout experiment group
      - "NoRuleMatch": The placement doesn't match any campaign rules

4. If you see "[usePaywall] ❌ Paywall ERROR":
   → Check the error message. Common issues:
      - Placement "onboarding_paywall" not configured in Superwall dashboard
      - No campaign attached to this placement
      - Network issues preventing config download

5. If logs stop after "[usePaywall] 📞 Calling registerPlacement...":
   → The registerPlacement call might be hanging or failing silently
   → Check Superwall configuration and network connectivity


WHAT TO DO NEXT:
----------------

1. Run your app and complete the questionnaire
2. Copy ALL the console logs after clicking Continue
3. Share them so we can identify exactly where the flow breaks
4. Check your Superwall dashboard:
   - Go to Campaigns
   - Verify "campaign_trigger" placement exists (this is the default)
   - Verify it's attached to a campaign with a paywall
   - Check campaign rules and audience matching

SUPERWALL DASHBOARD CHECKLIST:
------------------------------
□ Placement "campaign_trigger" exists (DEFAULT placement - should be there already!)
□ Campaign is created and active
□ Campaign includes "campaign_trigger" placement
□ Paywall is attached to the campaign
□ Campaign rules allow the user to see the paywall
□ Products are configured in Superwall
□ App is using correct API key (check App.tsx)
